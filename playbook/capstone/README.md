# Capstone Playbooks

> **Leadership Journey Portfolio Documentation**

---

## Overview

The capstone is a low-lift reflection exercise where participants document leadership moments from their real work and present one signature story to SLT at program close.

**Core Principle:** Capture, don't create. Participants notice and narrate their own growth—no invented projects, no extra deliverables.

## Design Principles

1. **Solo over group** — Leadership behavior is individual; you can't outsource "I showed confidence."
2. **Capture, don't create** — No extra workload; document what's already happening.
3. **One story, not a catalog** — SLT needs proof of concept, not comprehensive coverage.
4. **Forward declaration** — Closes the loop between past growth and future intention.

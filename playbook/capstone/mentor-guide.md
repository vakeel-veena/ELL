# Capstone Guide for Mentors

> **Supporting Signature Story Development**

---

## Your Role in the Capstone

Mentors provide **individual-level perspective** on the capstone. You're not evaluating, scoring, or directing—you're helping participants see their growth clearly and frame it effectively.

### What You Do

| Responsibility | How |
|---------------|-----|
| Validate moments | Confirm that logged moments reflect genuine shifts |
| Support story selection | Help weigh options when participant is stuck |
| Sharpen framing | Ask questions that clarify the "What Shifted" section |
| Build confidence | Remind them that authenticity beats polish |

### What You Don't Do

- Select the story for them
- Rewrite their narrative
- Evaluate their growth relative to others
- Replace Pod Manager's facilitation role

## Timing of Your Involvement

The capstone is primarily facilitated through Pods. Your involvement is **supplementary and targeted**, not ongoing.

| Phase | Your Role |
|-------|-----------|
| Ongoing logging | Minimal—Pod Manager prompts for moments |
| Story selection (2 weeks out) | Available for 1:1 conversation if participant is stuck |
| Story framing | Help sharpen the "What Shifted" section |
| Pre-presentation | Optional: listen to a rehearsal, provide feedback |

**Estimated time commitment:** 30–60 minutes per participant, concentrated in the final 2–3 weeks.

## Conversation Prompts

### When Reviewing Logged Moments

Start by reading their moment log. Then ask:

- "Walk me through this moment—what was happening?"
- "What made this feel like a shift for you?"
- "What would you have done differently a year ago?"

Listen for:
- Clear contrast between old behavior and new behavior
- Evidence of conscious choice (not just circumstance)
- Connection to something they learned in the program

### When They're Stuck on Selection

If they can't choose between moments:

- "Which moment surprised you the most?"
- "Which one would you want your manager to know about?"
- "If you could only share one thing you learned about yourself, which moment captures that?"

If none of their moments feel strong:

- "What's one thing you've done differently since the program started that you haven't written down yet?"
- "What would your pod members say you've shifted on?"
- "Tell me about a recent meeting or conversation that felt different than it would have before."

### When the Story Needs Sharpening

The most common gap: **weak "What Shifted" section**.

Questions to probe:

- "You've told me what happened. What did it teach you about yourself?"
- "If you could summarize your growth in one sentence, what would it be?"
- "What's different now in how you see yourself as a leader?"
- "What did you learn about what was holding you back?"

Help them move from:
- "I spoke up" → "I realized my hesitation was about waiting for permission"
- "I had a hard conversation" → "I learned that avoidance costs more than discomfort"
- "I pushed back on scope" → "I saw that my voice has weight when I use it clearly"

### When the Forward Declaration Is Vague

Push for specificity:

- "What would someone see you doing if you're keeping this commitment?"
- "How would you know if you did it next week?"
- "Can you say that in a way your manager could observe?"

Help them move from:
- "I'll be more confident" → "I will speak first in cross-team discussions"
- "I'll keep growing" → "I will frame decisions with my recommendation, not just options"

## Common Patterns You Might See

### Pattern: Underselling

**What it looks like:** "It wasn't a big deal" or "Anyone would have done that."

**How to respond:**
- "Would you have done it six months ago?"
- "What made it possible for you to do it now?"
- Don't inflate, but help them see the shift accurately.

### Pattern: Project-Update Mode

**What it looks like:** The story is about what got delivered, not how they showed up.

**How to respond:**
- "That's great progress on the project. What about how *you* operated—was there a behavioral shift?"
- "Imagine someone else delivered the same outcome but showed up differently. What would be different about your version?"

### Pattern: Performance Anxiety

**What it looks like:** Worried about impressing SLT, focused on polish.

**How to respond:**
- "SLT isn't evaluating your presentation skills. They're looking for evidence of growth."
- "The goal isn't to impress them—it's to show them something real."
- "Authenticity lands better than polish."

### Pattern: Can't Find a Moment

**What it looks like:** Log is empty or all entries feel forced.

**How to respond:**
- Explore recent work together: "What's been hard lately? How have you handled it?"
- Ask about program content: "Which Deep Dive resonated most? Where have you tried to apply it?"
- Lower the bar: "Even small shifts count. What's one tiny thing you've done differently?"

## Boundaries to Maintain

### Don't Rewrite Their Story

- Your job is to ask questions that help them find their own words.
- If you find yourself writing their narrative, step back.
- Their voice—imperfect as it may be—is what makes the story authentic.

### Don't Compare to Other Mentees

- Each participant's growth is individual.
- Avoid: "Your other mentee has a stronger story."
- Focus on helping *this* person find *their* shift.

### Don't Over-Involve

- The capstone is low-lift by design.
- If your involvement exceeds 60 minutes total, you're doing too much.
- Trust the Pod Manager and peer rehearsal process.

## Quick Reference: Things to Listen For

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "I don't have any moments" | May need help recognizing shifts they're underselling |
| "I just did my job" | Story may be about competence, not leadership shift |
| "This is what happened..." (no reflection) | "What Shifted" section needs development |
| "I hope to be more..." | Declaration is too vague; push for specificity |
| "Is this good enough?" | Seeking validation; help them own their story |

# Capstone Guide for Participants

## What Is the Capstone?

The capstone is your opportunity to document and share your leadership growth during this program. Unlike traditional projects, you're not building something new—you're **capturing what's already happening** as you apply leadership behaviors to your real work.

Think of it as a flight recorder for your development: moments that show how you're showing up differently.

## What You'll Deliver

| Component | What It Is | Effort |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Leadership Moments Log | 3–4 documented moments from your work | ~15–20 min per moment |
| Signature Story | One moment developed into a 3-minute presentation | ~2 hours prep |
| Forward Declaration | 30-second commitment for post-program | Part of story prep |

**Total estimated effort:** 4–5 hours across the program duration

## Part 1: Leadership Moments Log

### What Counts as a Moment?

A leadership moment is any situation where you **consciously chose** a different behavior than your old default. It doesn't have to be dramatic. Small shifts count.

**Examples of moments:**

- Speaking up first in a meeting instead of waiting to be asked
- Having a difficult conversation you would have previously avoided
- Pushing back on scope with clear reasoning instead of just accepting
- Taking ownership of a problem outside your defined responsibilities
- Framing a decision for leadership instead of just presenting options

**Not moments (yet):**

- "I did my job well" (competence, not leadership shift)
- "I finished the project" (delivery, not behavior change)
- "I feel more confident" (feeling, not observable action)

### How to Log a Moment

Use this structure for each moment:

---

**Moment #[1/2/3/4]**

**Date:** [When this happened]

**Deep Dive Connection:** [Which session theme applies—e.g., Confidence & Visibility]

**Situation**  
*What was happening? Who was involved? What was at stake?*

[2–3 sentences]

**Old Default**  
*What would I have done before this program?*

[1–2 sentences]

**What I Did Instead**  
*The leadership behavior I applied.*

[2–3 sentences]

**What Shifted**  
*What outcome or internal change did I notice?*

[1–2 sentences]

---

### When to Log

- **Immediately after it happens** is best (details are fresh)
- At minimum, **weekly review** to capture moments before they fade
- Pod sessions will prompt you to surface recent moments

### How Many?

- **Minimum:** 3 moments across the program
- **Target:** 4 moments (one per Deep Dive theme is ideal)
- **Maximum:** 5 (more isn't better; depth beats breadth)

---

## Part 2: Signature Story

### What Is It?

Your signature story is **one moment** from your log, developed into a 3-minute narrative for SLT. This is your clearest example of leadership growth—the one that best captures your shift.

### Story Structure

| Section | Content | Duration |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Context** | Set the scene. What was happening? Who was involved? What was at stake? | 30 seconds |
| **The Choice Point** | What did you do differently? Why? What leadership behavior were you applying? | 90 seconds |
| **What It Revealed** | What does this moment show about your growth? What shifted in how you see yourself as a leader? | 60 seconds |

### Selecting Your Story

Ask yourself:

1. **Which moment shows the clearest "before and after"?**
   - The contrast between old default and new behavior should be visible

2. **Which moment would resonate with SLT?**
   - Think about what they care about: ownership, initiative, influence

3. **Which moment feels most authentic to you?**
   - Don't pick what sounds impressive—pick what felt real

4. **Can you tell it in 3 minutes?**
   - If the context requires 5 minutes of setup, it's too complex

### Story Development Tips

**DO:**
- Be specific (names, dates, details make it real)
- Name the internal shift, not just the external action
- Practice out loud—timing matters
- Get feedback from your pod before presenting

**DON'T:**
- Turn it into a project update
- Overexplain the context
- Skip the "What Shifted" section (this is the whole point)
- Read from a script (know your story, don't recite it)

## Part 3: Forward Declaration

### What Is It?

A 30-second commitment statement that follows your signature story:

> "One leadership behavior I'm committing to sustain beyond this program is..."

### What Makes a Good Declaration?

| Good Declaration | Why It Works |
|-----------------|--------------|
| "I will speak first in cross-team discussions instead of waiting to be asked." | Specific, observable, ties to learned behavior |
| "I will initiate one difficult conversation per month that I would have previously avoided." | Measurable, connected to growth area |
| "I will frame decisions with my recommendation, not just options." | Behavioral, can be seen by managers |

| Weak Declaration | Why It Doesn't Work |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "I will be more confident." | Too vague, not observable |
| "I hope to take on more leadership." | "Hope" isn't commitment |
| "I'll keep growing." | Says nothing specific |

### Why It Matters

Your forward declaration gives your manager something **concrete to reinforce**. When they see the behavior, they can acknowledge it. When it's vague, it disappears.

## Timeline

| When | What You Do |
|------|-------------|
| **Now (Post Deep Dive 1)** | Understand the capstone; log first moment if you have one |
| **Ongoing** | Log moments as they happen (1–2 per Deep Dive period) |
| **Pod Sessions** | Share moments; get peer perspective on what counts |
| **2 Weeks Before Close** | Select signature story; draft forward declaration |
| **Final Week** | Rehearse in pod; refine based on feedback |
| **Program Close** | Present to SLT (3 min + 30 sec) |

## FAQs

### "I can't think of any moments."

This is common—leadership shifts often feel invisible from the inside. Try:
- Ask your pod: "What have you seen me do differently?"
- Review the Deep Dive themes and scan recent weeks for matches
- Lower your bar: small shifts count

### "My moment feels too small."

If you consciously chose a different behavior, it counts. "I spoke up in a meeting I would have stayed quiet in" is valid. The capstone isn't about drama—it's about evidence of change.

### "Can I change my signature story later?"

Yes. You can log moments throughout the program and select your signature story closer to the end. Often, later moments are clearer because you have more practice.

### "What if I don't finish all 4 moments?"

3 moments is the minimum. If you only have 3, that's acceptable. But aim for 4—it gives you options when selecting your signature story.

### "Will this be graded?"

No. The capstone is not a performance evaluation. It's an opportunity to articulate your growth. SLT is looking for evidence that the program works, not ranking participants.

## One Final Note

This capstone is about **you noticing your own growth**. The act of documenting moments—of pausing to say "I did that differently"—is itself a leadership behavior.

The best portfolios aren't the most dramatic. They're the most honest.

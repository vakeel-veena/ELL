# Presentation Prep Guide

> **Developing Your Signature Story for SLT**

---

## The Goal

In 3 minutes and 30 seconds, you will:

1. **Tell one story** that shows your leadership growth (3 minutes)
2. **Make one commitment** for what you'll sustain post-program (30 seconds)

That's it. No slides. No deck. Just you, your story, and your commitment.

---

## The Story Arc

Your signature story has three parts. Each part has a job to do.

### Part 1: Context (30 seconds)

**Job:** Set the scene quickly so the audience knows what's at stake.

**Include:**
- When and where this happened (be specific)
- Who was involved (roles, not necessarily names)
- What was at stake (why this moment mattered)

**Avoid:**
- Excessive backstory ("Let me give you some context...")
- Project details that don't matter to the behavioral shift
- Hedging ("This might not seem like a big deal, but...")

**Example:**
> "Three weeks ago, I was in an architecture review with senior engineers from Seattle. We were debating our approach to the data migration, and I had a different view than what was emerging as the consensus."

### Part 2: The Choice Point (90 seconds)

**Job:** Show what you did differently and why it matters.

**Include:**
- What your old default would have been (the "before")
- What you consciously chose to do instead (the "after")
- How you did it (specifics make it real)
- What happened as a result

**Avoid:**
- Glossing over the contrast ("I just decided to speak up")
- Making it sound effortless (the struggle is part of the story)
- Focusing only on the outcome without the internal shift

**Example:**
> "Before this program, I would have prepared my points but waited for someone to ask me directly. I would have assumed that if my perspective was valuable, someone would draw it out of me.
>
> Instead, I opened the discussion with my recommendation before being prompted. I said: 'I want to put a stake in the ground—I think Option B is the right path, and here's why.' I framed the trade-offs clearly and held my position when questioned. I didn't back down when a senior engineer pushed back; I asked clarifying questions and restated my reasoning.
>
> By the end of the meeting, we had landed on a hybrid approach that incorporated my recommendation. But more importantly, two people messaged me afterward saying they appreciated that I had moved the conversation forward."

### Part 3: What It Revealed (60 seconds)

**Job:** Name the internal shift—what you learned about yourself as a leader.

**Include:**
- What this moment taught you about your growth
- How it connects to what you learned in the program
- What's different now in how you see yourself

**Avoid:**
- Skipping this section (it's the whole point)
- Generic lessons ("I learned to be more confident")
- Crediting the moment to luck or circumstances

**Example:**
> "What shifted for me was realizing that my hesitation wasn't about competence. I knew the technical material. My hesitation was about waiting for permission that wasn't coming—permission to take up space, permission to have a strong point of view.
>
> The Confidence & Visibility session helped me see that showing up visibly isn't arrogance; it's contribution. Now, I notice when I'm shrinking, and I have a choice about whether to stay small or step forward."

---

## The Forward Declaration (30 seconds)

**Job:** Commit to one specific behavior you'll sustain after the program.

**Structure:**

> "One leadership behavior I'm committing to sustain beyond this program is: **[specific, observable action]**."

**Good Examples:**

| Declaration | Why It Works |
|-------------|--------------|
| "I will speak first in cross-team discussions instead of waiting to be asked." | Specific context, clear behavioral shift |
| "I will frame decisions with my recommendation before presenting options." | Observable, ties to Judgment theme |
| "I will initiate one difficult conversation per month that I would have previously avoided." | Measurable, connected to Influence theme |

**Weak Examples:**

| Declaration | Why It Doesn't Work |
|-------------|---------------------|
| "I will be more confident." | Not observable; what would someone see? |
| "I'll keep applying what I learned." | Vague; doesn't commit to anything specific |
| "I hope to take on more leadership." | "Hope" isn't a commitment |

**Test Your Declaration:**

- Could your manager observe this behavior?
- Would you know if you were doing it or not?
- Does it connect to your signature story?

## Preparation Checklist

### 2 Weeks Before

- [ ] Review your logged moments
- [ ] Select your signature story
- [ ] Draft the three parts (Context, Choice Point, What It Revealed)
- [ ] Draft your forward declaration
- [ ] Read it aloud once—does it flow?

### 1 Week Before

- [ ] Time yourself (should be ~3:30 total)
- [ ] Cut context if you're over 4 minutes
- [ ] Expand "What It Revealed" if you're under 3 minutes
- [ ] Practice without reading—know your story, don't recite it

### Final Week (Pod Rehearsal)

- [ ] Present to your pod
- [ ] Receive feedback on:
  - Clarity of the before/after contrast
  - Whether the internal shift is clear
  - Whether the declaration is specific
- [ ] Refine based on feedback
- [ ] Practice 2–3 more times on your own

### Day Before

- [ ] One final run-through (out loud, timed)
- [ ] Get a good night's sleep
- [ ] Trust that you know your story

## Delivery Tips

### Presence

- **Start with a breath.** Take a moment before you begin.
- **Make eye contact.** Pick 2–3 people in the room; move between them.
- **Stand still.** You don't need to pace; grounded presence is powerful.

### Pacing

- **Slow down.** Nerves speed you up. Consciously pause between sections.
- **Let moments land.** After the "What It Revealed" section, a beat of silence is okay.
- **Don't rush the declaration.** It's your closing statement—give it weight.

### Authenticity

- **This is your story.** No one can tell it better than you.
- **You don't need to be polished.** You need to be honest.
- **If you get lost, pause.** Take a breath and pick up where you know you are.

### What If You Forget Something?

It's okay. SLT is not evaluating your performance. They're looking for evidence of growth. If you forget a detail:
- Skip it and keep going
- Or say: "The key point is..." and continue

---

## What SLT Is Looking For

| They Want to See | They Don't Need |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Evidence that the program works | Perfect delivery |
| Real behavioral shifts | Dramatic transformations |
| Self-awareness about growth | False humility |
| Commitment to sustained change | Polished presentation skills |

Your job is to show that you're developing as a leader, not to impress them with your speaking ability.

## Common Pitfalls

### The Project Update Trap

**Symptom:** Your story is mostly about what got delivered.

**Fix:** Ask yourself: "What did I do differently as a leader?" The shift is in *you*, not the work output.

### The Context Quicksand

**Symptom:** You're 2 minutes in and haven't reached the choice point.

**Fix:** Start the story closer to the moment of decision. The audience doesn't need full backstory.

### The Glossed-Over Shift

**Symptom:** "I just decided to speak up, and it went well."

**Fix:** Slow down. What did you actually feel? What was hard about it? Where did you draw on what you learned?

### The Vague Declaration

**Symptom:** "I'll keep being more confident."

**Fix:** Make it observable. What would someone see? What specific action will you take?

**Total time:** ~3 minutes 30 seconds

## Final Thought

The best stories aren't the most dramatic. They're the most honest.

Your moment doesn't need to be a career-defining breakthrough. It needs to be *yours*—a real shift in how you showed up, told in a way that others can see themselves in.

Trust your story. You lived it. Now share it.

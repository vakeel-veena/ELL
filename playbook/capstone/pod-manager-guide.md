# Capstone Guide for Pod Managers

> **Facilitating Leadership Journey Portfolios**

## Your Role in the Capstone

You are not evaluating or grading. You are **helping participants see their own growth** and **creating space** for reflection and peer support.

### What You Do

| Responsibility | How |
|---------------|-----|
| Prompt for moments | Use standing questions in pod sessions |
| Help recognition | Surface behaviors participants undersell |
| Support selection | Guide signature story choice |
| Facilitate rehearsal | Run peer feedback in final week |

### What You Don't Do

- Evaluate quality of moments
- Select signature stories for participants
- Provide solutions or "better" examples
- Replace participant's authentic voice

---

## Pod Session Integration

The capstone doesn't require dedicated sessions. It integrates into existing pod conversations.

### Standing Prompt (Every Session)

Add this question to each pod session:

> "What's one moment in the last two weeks where you made a choice you wouldn't have made three months ago?"

**Why this works:**
- Frames moments as behavioral shifts, not achievements
- Creates peer accountability for reflection
- Surfaces material before it fades

### Facilitation Tips

**When someone shares a moment:**
- Validate without inflating: "That sounds like a real shift."
- Ask one follow-up: "What felt different for you in that moment?"
- Invite peer reflection: "Anyone else recognize this pattern?"

**When someone says "I don't have anything":**
- Normalize it: "Sometimes moments feel invisible from the inside."
- Prompt the group: "Has anyone seen [name] do something differently lately?"
- Connect to Deep Dive: "Thinking about Confidence & Visibility—any situations where you showed up differently than you would have before?"

**When a moment is actually a project update:**
- Redirect gently: "That's great progress on the project. What about how *you* operated—was there a behavior shift?"
- Clarify the criteria: "We're looking for moments where you chose a different approach, not just delivered well."

## Helping Participants Recognize Moments

### Common Underselling Patterns

| What They Say | What It Actually Is |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "I just spoke up in the meeting." | Confidence & Visibility moment—they initiated instead of waiting |
| "I had that conversation I was avoiding." | Influence moment—they took ownership of a difficult dynamic |
| "I pushed back on the deadline." | Judgment moment—they advocated for quality with reasoning |
| "It wasn't a big deal." | Probably a real shift they're minimizing |

### Reframing Prompts

Use these when participants dismiss valid moments:

- "Walk me through what you *would* have done before the program."
- "What made you choose differently this time?"
- "What did it feel like to make that choice?"
- "If a colleague did what you did, would you see it as a leadership behavior?"

## Supporting Signature Story Selection

### Timing

- 2 weeks before program close, participants should select their signature story
- This can happen in pod session or individually—your role is to be available

### Selection Criteria to Share

Help participants ask themselves:

1. **Clearest contrast:** Which moment shows the most visible before/after?
2. **Resonance with SLT:** Which moment speaks to what leadership cares about?
3. **Authenticity:** Which moment feels most real and owned?
4. **Tellable in 3 minutes:** Which moment doesn't require extensive setup?

### When They're Stuck Between Options

Ask:
- "If you could only share one thing you learned about yourself, which moment captures that?"
- "Which moment would you want your manager to know about?"
- "Which one makes you most proud—not because it was impressive, but because it was hard?"

## Facilitating Peer Rehearsal

### Final Week: Pod Rehearsal Session

**Format:** Each participant presents their signature story (3 min) + forward declaration (30 sec) to the pod.

**Structure:**

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Setup | 5 min | Remind group of feedback norms |
| Presentations | 4 min × pod size | Story + declaration per person |
| Peer feedback | 2 min per person | Structured feedback after each |
| Wrap-up | 5 min | Final encouragement |

### Feedback Norms

Before starting, establish:

- **Be specific:** "When you said X, it landed because..." not "Great job!"
- **Focus on clarity, not judgment:** "I wasn't sure what shifted for you—can you say more?"
- **Stay in service of the presenter:** This is about helping them, not critiquing them
- **One thing that worked, one thing to sharpen:** Simple structure

### Feedback Prompts

Give these to the group:

**What worked:**
- "The moment that landed most was..."
- "Your contrast between before and after was clear when..."
- "Your declaration felt actionable because..."

**What to sharpen:**
- "I wanted to hear more about..."
- "The context took a while—could you trim the setup?"
- "What specifically did *you* do differently? I heard the situation but not your choice."

### Your Role During Rehearsal

- **Timekeeper:** Keep presentations to 3.5 minutes total
- **Model feedback:** Give the first feedback to demonstrate the tone
- **Redirect critique:** If feedback turns harsh, reframe toward constructive
- **Note patterns:** Track common gaps to address with the group

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Participant has logged zero moments with 2 weeks left

**Response:**
- 1:1 conversation to understand the block
- Review Deep Dive themes together and prompt for specific examples
- Lower the bar: "What's one small thing you've done differently?"
- Involve their mentor if needed

### Challenge: All moments sound like project updates

**Response:**
- Clarify the distinction between "what I delivered" and "how I showed up"
- Ask: "What's something you did that your old self wouldn't have?"
- Share an example moment to illustrate the behavioral focus

### Challenge: Signature story is 6 minutes of context

**Response:**
- Help them find the kernel: "What's the one sentence version of the situation?"
- Suggest starting later in the timeline: "What if you start 30 seconds before the choice point?"
- Run a timed practice: "Let's see how much you can cut while keeping the core."

### Challenge: Forward declaration is vague

**Response:**
- Push for specificity: "What would your manager see you doing?"
- Test observability: "How would someone know you're keeping this commitment?"
- Offer a structure: "I will [specific action] in [specific context] instead of [old default]."

### Challenge: Participant is anxious about presenting to SLT

**Response:**
- Normalize: "Everyone's nervous. That's okay."
- Focus on authenticity: "SLT wants to see your growth, not your polish."
- Suggest grounding: "Start with one breath. Make eye contact with one person. Begin."

## What Success Looks Like

For your pod, the capstone succeeds when:

| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| All participants have logged moments | 3–4 moments per person documented |
| Stories reflect real behavioral shifts | Moments tie to program themes, not just work output |
| Peer rehearsal generates useful feedback | Presentations improve between rehearsal and final |
| Participants own their stories | They're not reciting—they're telling |
| Forward declarations are specific | Managers can observe and reinforce |

## Quick Reference: Pod Session Capstone Check-Ins

### Weeks 1–3 (Post Deep Dive 1)

> "Has anyone had a moment where you showed up differently this week? Even a small one?"

### Weeks 4–6 (Mid-Program)

> "How many moments have you logged so far? What's blocking you if you haven't started?"

### Weeks 7–8 (Pre-Selection)

> "Which moment is standing out as your signature story? What's making the choice hard?"

### Final Week (Rehearsal)

> "Let's hear your story. We'll give you feedback on what lands and what to sharpen."

## Agenda: Option A (Full Cohort)

**Total Duration:** 90 minutes

| Time | Segment | Owner | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| 0:00 | Opening framing | Program Lead | 5 min—program purpose, capstone intent, what to expect |
| 0:05 | Participant presentations | Participants | 3.5 min each × 23 = ~80 min |
| 1:25 | SLT reflection questions | SLT | 5 min—2–3 questions to whole group |
| 1:30 | Closing | Program Lead | Thank participants, next steps |

### Facilitation Notes

**Opening Framing (5 min)**

Key points to cover:
- Purpose of the program (leadership readiness, not promotion)
- What the capstone represents (evidence of behavioral shift)
- What SLT will hear (signature stories + commitments)
- How to listen (for authenticity, not polish)

Sample script:
> "Over the past [X weeks], these 23 participants have been developing leadership behaviors—leading self, influencing without authority, exercising judgment. Today, each of them will share one moment that captures their growth, followed by a commitment they're making to sustain this beyond the program.
>
> You're not here to evaluate their presentation skills. You're here to see evidence that this program works—that people are showing up differently in their work.
>
> We'll hear from everyone in order. Each person has 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Please hold questions until the end."

**During Presentations**

- Use a visible timer (phone, laptop, or physical timer)
- At 3:00, give a subtle signal (hand gesture or note) if needed
- At 3:30, thank the presenter and call the next name
- Do not interrupt or provide commentary between presenters
- Track any participants who significantly exceed time (address in debrief)

**SLT Reflection (5 min)**

Prompt SLT with open questions:
- "What patterns did you notice across the stories?"
- "What signals do these stories give you about the program's impact?"
- "What's one thing you heard that resonated with you?"

Avoid questions that put individual participants on the spot.

**Closing (2 min)**

- Thank participants for their courage and vulnerability
- Thank SLT for their investment and attention
- Preview next steps (e.g., manager follow-up, program report)

## Agenda: Option B (Representative Sample)

**Total Duration:** 40 minutes

| Time | Segment | Owner | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| 0:00 | Opening framing | Program Lead | 5 min—program purpose, capstone intent, portfolio overview |
| 0:05 | Pod representative presentations | 5 Participants | 3.5 min each × 5 = ~18 min |
| 0:23 | Portfolio handoff | Program Lead | 5 min—highlight written portfolios available |
| 0:28 | Q&A with representatives | SLT | 10 min |
| 0:38 | Closing | Program Lead | 2 min |

### Selection of Representatives

**Method:** Each pod selects one representative. Selection can be:
- Volunteer-based (who wants to present?)
- Pod consensus (who best represents the pod's journey?)
- Pod Manager recommendation (with participant consent)

**Criteria to share with pods:**
- Willingness to present to SLT
- Story that illustrates a clear behavioral shift
- Not necessarily the "best" story—authentic and representative

**Timing:** Finalize representatives 1 week before event.

### Portfolio Artifact

For Option B, the portfolio serves as visibility for non-presenting participants.

**Contents:**
- Cover page with program overview
- Participant roster with pod assignments
- Individual pages per participant with:
  - Name and role
  - Signature story summary (written version, 150–200 words)
  - Forward declaration
- Appendix: Program structure overview

**Distribution:** Share with SLT 24 hours before (digital PDF or printed).

## Contingency Plans

### Participant No-Show

- Note the absence, do not fill the slot
- In closing, mention: "[Name] was unable to join today; their portfolio is available in the written artifact."

### Participant Exceeds Time Significantly

- At 4:00, politely interrupt: "Thank you, [Name]. Let's move to your declaration."
- Do not penalize; address in post-event debrief if needed

### Technical Issues (Virtual/Hybrid)

- Have a backup audio dial-in number
- Pre-test AV 30 minutes before
- If participant cannot be heard, offer to read their written story summary

### SLT Needs to Leave Early

- Front-load the strongest stories (work with Pod Managers to identify)
- Ensure portfolio artifact is already distributed

---

## Post-Event Actions

### Within 24 Hours

- [ ] Send thank-you to participants
- [ ] Send thank-you + portfolio to SLT
- [ ] Collect participant feedback on capstone experience

### Within 1 Week

- [ ] Debrief with Pod Managers: what worked, what to improve
- [ ] Compile manager talking points (participant names + forward declarations)
- [ ] Log program metrics: completion rate, SLT feedback signals

### For Program Report

- [ ] Summarize themes from signature stories
- [ ] Aggregate forward declarations into categories
- [ ] Note any standout moments to reference in future program design

# Capstone Playbook: Leadership Journey Portfolio

> **Version:** 1.0

## 1. Purpose

The capstone is the program's "flight recorder"—it captures evidence of leadership growth through real work, not invented projects. Participants document moments where they consciously applied leadership behaviors learned in the program, then present one signature story to SLT at program close.

### What This Is

- A **low-lift reflection exercise** embedded in ongoing work
- A way for participants to **notice and narrate** their own growth
- Evidence of **behavioral change**, not project delivery

### What This Is Not

- A separate project with its own deliverables
- A performance evaluation mechanism
- A group assignment where effort concentrates on one person

---

## 2. Design Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Solo over group | Leadership behavior is individual—you can't outsource "I showed confidence in that review" |
| Capture, don't create | No extra workload; document what's already happening |
| One story, not a catalog | SLT needs proof of concept, not comprehensive coverage |
| Forward declaration | Closes the loop between past growth and future intention |

---

## 3. Capstone Components

### 3.1 Leadership Moments Log (Ongoing)

Participants identify **3–4 moments** during the program where they consciously applied a leadership behavior. Each moment gets a brief capture using the template format.

**Per-Moment Structure:**

| Field | Description | Length |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Situation | What was happening? | 2–3 sentences |
| Old Default | What would I have done before this program? | 1–2 sentences |
| What I Did Instead | The leadership behavior I applied | 2–3 sentences |
| What Shifted | Outcome or internal shift I noticed | 1–2 sentences |

This is tagging specific incidents, not journaling. Think: black box data, not full flight recording.

**Moment Categories (aligned to Deep Dives):**

- Confidence & Visibility moments
- Influence Without Authority moments
- Judgment & Decision-Making moments
- [Additional categories per program design]

### 3.2 Signature Story (Presentation-Ready)

From the 3–4 logged moments, participants select **one** to develop into a 3-minute story for SLT.

**Story Arc:**

| Segment | Content | Duration |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Context | Set the scene—what was at stake | 30 seconds |
| Choice Point | What I did and why—the leadership behavior in action | 90 seconds |
| Growth Revealed | What this moment showed about my development | 60 seconds |

### 3.3 Forward Declaration (Closing Statement)

A 30-second commitment statement following the signature story:

> "One leadership behavior I'm committing to sustain beyond this program is..."

This gives managers something concrete to reinforce post-program.

## 4. Timeline Integration

| Program Phase | Capstone Activity | Owner |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| After Deep Dive 1 (Confidence & Visibility) ✓ | Introduce capstone; first moment capture if applicable | Program Lead |
| During Deep Dives 2–N | Log moments as they happen (1–2 per deep dive period) | Participant |
| Pod Sessions (ongoing) | Surface moments; peer support on recognition | Pod Manager |
| 2 weeks before close | Select signature story; draft forward declaration | Participant |
| Final week | Pod-level rehearsal with peer feedback | Pod Manager |
| Program Close | SLT Presentation | Program Lead |

---

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities

### Participant

- Log 3–4 leadership moments throughout program
- Select and prepare signature story
- Deliver 3-minute presentation + forward declaration

### Pod Manager

- Prompt for moments during pod sessions
- Help participants recognize behaviors they're underselling
- Facilitate story selection and peer rehearsal
- **Does not evaluate or grade capstone**

### Program Lead

- Introduce capstone framework
- Coordinate SLT presentation logistics
- Synthesize themes for program-level insights

### Mentor

- Provide perspective on moment selection
- Support story framing and clarity
- **Does not replace participant's voice**

---

## 6. SLT Presentation Format

### Option A: Full Cohort Showcase (Recommended)

**Duration:** 75–90 minutes for 23 participants

| Element | Duration | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Opening framing | 5 minutes | Program Lead sets context |
| Individual presentations | 3.5 min each × 23 | Story (3 min) + Declaration (30 sec) |
| Closing reflection | 10 minutes | SLT asks 2–3 questions to whole group |

**Why this works:** Everyone is seen. Signals the program values each participant's growth, not just polished presenters.

### Option B: Representative Sample + Portfolio Access

**Duration:** 30–40 minutes

| Element | Duration | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Opening framing | 5 minutes | Program Lead sets context |
| Pod representatives | 3.5 min × 5 | One per pod, selected by pod |
| Portfolio handoff | 5 minutes | All 23 portfolios available as written artifact |
| Q&A | 10 minutes | SLT engages with representatives |

**Use this if:** SLT time is severely constrained. Preserves visibility through written artifacts.

---

## 7. What Makes This Low-Lift

| Traditional Capstone | This Approach |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Invent a new project | Capture existing work |
| Significant extra hours | 15–20 minutes per moment logged |
| Group coordination overhead | Individual accountability |
| Presentation prep anxiety | One practiced story, authentic material |
| Success = external output | Success = internal shift, articulated |

The heaviest lift is selecting the signature story and rehearsing it. That's a feature—presentation skills tie directly to Confidence & Visibility.

## 8. Common Challenges & Mitigations

### Challenge: Participants struggle to identify moments

**Why it happens:** Leadership behaviors feel invisible when you're inside them.

**Mitigation:**
- Pod standing prompt: *"What's one moment in the last two weeks where you made a choice you wouldn't have made three months ago?"*
- Peers often see each other's growth before they see their own

### Challenge: Moments feel "too small" to count

**Why it happens:** Participants expect dramatic transformations.

**Mitigation:**
- Normalize small shifts: "The moment you spoke up first in that meeting instead of waiting—that counts."
- Pod Managers validate and amplify appropriately-sized examples

### Challenge: Stories become project updates, not behavioral reflection

**Why it happens:** Default to what feels safe and familiar.

**Mitigation:**
- Story template forces behavioral lens
- Peer feedback in rehearsal catches drift
- "What shifted in you?" is required, not optional

### Challenge: Forward declarations are vague

**Why it happens:** Committing feels risky.

**Mitigation:**
- Make declarations specific and observable: "I will..." not "I hope to..."
- Managers can reference declarations in follow-up conversations

## 9. Success Criteria

The capstone succeeds when:

| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Participation is complete | 23/23 portfolios submitted |
| Moments reflect real behavioral shifts | Stories cite specific program concepts applied |
| SLT engagement is substantive | Questions go beyond "nice job" |
| Forward declarations are actionable | Managers can observe and reinforce |
| Program credibility is reinforced | SLT sees tangible ROI on investment |

## Appendix: Sample Moments by Deep Dive

### Confidence & Visibility

> **Situation:** Architecture review with senior engineers from Seattle.  
> **Old Default:** I would have prepared my points but waited for someone to ask me directly.  
> **What I Did Instead:** I opened the discussion with my recommendation before being prompted, framed the trade-offs clearly, and held my position when questioned.  
> **What Shifted:** I realized my hesitation wasn't about competence—I was waiting for permission that wasn't coming.

### Influence Without Authority

> **Situation:** Cross-team dependency blocking sprint commitment.  
> **Old Default:** Escalate to my manager and let them sort it out.  
> **What I Did Instead:** Set up a direct conversation with the other team's lead, came with options instead of just the problem, and landed on a mutual commitment.  
> **What Shifted:** I saw that influence is about making it easy for others to say yes, not about having authority to demand.

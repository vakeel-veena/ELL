# Mentor Guidance  
**Leadership Development Program – Senior Individual Contributors**

## Your Role as a Mentor

You are here to **build leadership judgment**, not to provide solutions.

Your value is not in answers.  
Your value is in perspective, framing, and pattern recognition.

If a mentee leaves with:
- Clearer thinking
- Stronger ownership of their decision
- Increased confidence in ambiguity

…you did your job.

---

## What You Are — and Are Not

### You Are
- A sounding board for leadership judgment
- A mirror for blind spots and patterns
- A perspective-builder
- A confidence calibrator

### You Are Not
- A problem solver
- A delivery coach
- An escalation path
- A substitute for the line manager

If mentees want answers, redirect them to their manager.

## The Mentoring Arc (What to Expect)

### Sessions 1–2: Framing & Trust
- Context sharing
- Understanding scope and constraints
- Normalizing uncertainty

Do not push for outcomes yet.

---

### Sessions 3–5: Judgment Building
This is where mentees often stall.

Your job is to:
- Ask how they framed decisions
- Explore trade-offs they accepted or avoided
- Probe influence attempts
- Surface hesitation and confidence gaps

Always ask:
> “What did you decide or attempt since we last spoke?”

---

### Sessions 6+: Pattern Recognition
Shift from events to patterns:
- What do they consistently avoid?
- Where do they default to safety?
- What kind of influence feels hardest?

You are helping them **see themselves clearly**.

---

## How to Handle Solution-Seeking

If a mentee asks:
> “What should I do?”

Respond with:
- “What options are you considering?”
- “What are you optimizing for?”
- “What trade-off are you willing to accept?”
- “What risk feels uncomfortable here?”

Do not answer the question directly.

Redirect to their thinking.

---

## Signals to Watch For

Positive signals:
- Increased ownership language (“I decided…”)
- Willingness to name trade-offs
- Attempts to influence without authority
- Increased confidence in ambiguity

Concerning signals:
- Repeated deferral (“I’m waiting to be told…”)
- Avoidance of visibility
- Over-indexing on safety
- Expectation that you will decide

Surface patterns, not incidents.

---

## Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

- Do not manage delivery
- Do not override the line manager
- Do not give step-by-step plans
- Do not evaluate performance

If boundaries blur, reset explicitly.

---

## What a Good Session Feels Like

A good session may feel:
- Uncomfortable
- Unresolved
- Incomplete

That is normal.

Clarity of judgment matters more than closure.

---

## Final Reminder

Mentorship works only if:
- The mentee does the thinking
- You protect the space
- Judgment improves over time

Your restraint is a feature, not a failure.

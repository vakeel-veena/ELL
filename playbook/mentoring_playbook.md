# Mentoring Handbook: Leadership Development Program

## 1. Core Philosophy: Judgment over Solutions
The primary goal of mentorship in this program is to **build leadership judgment**. You are successful if the participant leaves with clearer thinking, stronger ownership of their decisions, and increased confidence in ambiguity.

### Role Boundaries
* **Mentors are**: Sounding boards for leadership judgment, mirrors for blind spots, perspective-builders, and confidence calibrators.
* **Mentors are NOT**: Problem solvers, delivery coaches, escalation paths, or substitutes for line managers.
* **Redirection Rule**: If a mentee asks "What should I do?", do not answer directly; instead, redirect them to their own thinking and options.

## 2. The Mentoring Arc
The engagement is divided into three deliberate phases to move from relationship building to behavioral change.

| Phase | Sessions | Focus | Key Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Framing & Trust** | 1–2 | Context & Alignment | Establishing trust, understanding scope, and normalizing uncertainty. |
| **2. Judgment Building** | 3–5 | Behavioral Review | Reviewing leadership behavior using specific lenses: Decisions, Influence, or Confidence. |
| **3. Pattern Recognition** | 6+ | Self-Awareness | Shifting from events to recurring defaults, such as avoiding visibility or over-indexing on safety. |

## 3. Mandatory Preparation (The Pre-Read)
To ensure the mentee does the thinking, they must submit a reflection **24 hours before every session** starting after Session 2.

**Required Reflection Format**:
* **One decision** made.
* **One influence attempt**.
* **One moment of hesitation**.
* **The "Lens"** they want to discuss (Decision, Influence, or Confidence/Visibility).

> **Protocol**: If the mentee feels they have "nothing to bring," that observation itself becomes the discussion topic.

## 4. Facilitating Through the "Stall" (Sessions 3–5)
When mentees seek answers or feel stuck, use these redirects to return the cognitive load to them:
* "What options are you considering?"
* "What are you optimizing for?"
* "What trade-off are you willing to accept?"
* "What risk feels uncomfortable here?"
* "If this fails, why will it fail?"

## 5. Success Signals
* **Positive Signals**: Increased ownership language ("I decided"), willingness to name trade-offs, and attempts to influence without authority.
* **Concerning Signals**: Repeated deferral ("I’m waiting to be told"), avoidance of visibility, and an expectation that the mentor will decide.

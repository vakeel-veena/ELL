# Mentoring Playbook  
**Leadership Development Program – Senior Individual Contributors**

---

## 1. Purpose of Mentorship

Mentorship in this program exists to **build leadership judgment**, not to provide solutions.

A successful mentoring session results in:
- Clearer framing
- Stronger confidence in the participant’s own decision
- One assumption to test or one behavior to try

A session that ends with a step-by-step answer or borrowed decision has failed its purpose.

## 2. What Mentorship Is — and Is Not

### Mentorship *Is*
- Pressure-testing thinking
- Surfacing blind spots and assumptions
- Building leadership judgment under ambiguity
- Strengthening confidence, presence, and influence

### Mentorship Is *Not*
- Problem-solving or delivery support
- An escalation path
- A replacement for line management
- Advice on “what you should do”

> If you want answers, talk to your manager.  
> If you want better judgment, use your mentor.

## 3. The Mentoring Arc

Mentorship progresses through three deliberate phases.  
Lack of momentum after early sessions is **expected**, not a failure.

---

### Phase 1: Framing & Trust (Sessions 1–2)

**Goal**
- Establish context
- Build trust
- Align on expectations

**What to Bring**
- Role, scope, constraints
- Situations where leadership feels hard or unclear

**What Not to Expect**
- Immediate momentum
- Prescriptive advice

These sessions often feel good but are foundational only.

---

### Phase 2: Judgment Building (Sessions 3–5)

This is where many mentees feel “stuck.”  
This is intentional.

From this point onward, sessions are **not about new problems** —  
they are about **reviewing leadership behavior**.

Each session must use **one** of the lenses below.

---

#### Lens A — Decision Review

    ```
Decision I made:
<ul>
<li>What I chose</li>
<li>What I optimized for</li>
<li>What trade-off I accepted</li>
</ul>
What I want perspective on:
<ul>
<li>Was my framing strong?</li>
</ul>

    ```

#### Lens B — Influence Attempt Review
    ```
Where I tried to influence without authority:
<ul>
<li>Who I was trying to influence</li>
<li>Why it mattered</li>
<li>What happened</li>
</ul>
What I want help with:
<ul><li>
What I misread or underused</li>

    ```

# Mentoring Playbook  
**Leadership Development Program – Senior Individual Contributors**

---

## 1. Purpose of Mentorship

Mentorship in this program exists to **build leadership judgment**, not to provide solutions.

A successful mentoring session results in:
- Clearer framing
- Stronger confidence in the participant’s own decision
- One assumption to test or one behavior to try

A session that ends with a step-by-step answer or borrowed decision has failed its purpose.

---

## 2. What Mentorship Is — and Is Not

### Mentorship *Is*
- Pressure-testing thinking
- Surfacing blind spots and assumptions
- Building leadership judgment under ambiguity
- Strengthening confidence, presence, and influence

### Mentorship Is *Not*
- Problem-solving or delivery support
- An escalation path
- A replacement for line management
- Advice on “what you should do”

> If you want answers, talk to your manager.  
> If you want better judgment, use your mentor.

## 3. The Mentoring Arc

Mentorship progresses through three deliberate phases.  
Lack of momentum after early sessions is **expected**, not a failure.

---

### Phase 1: Framing & Trust (Sessions 1–2)

**Goal**
- Establish context
- Build trust
- Align on expectations

**What to Bring**
- Role, scope, constraints
- Situations where leadership feels hard or unclear

**What Not to Expect**
- Immediate momentum
- Prescriptive advice

These sessions often feel good but are foundational only.

---

### Phase 2: Judgment Building (Sessions 3–5)

This is where many mentees feel “stuck.”  
This is intentional.

From this point onward, sessions are **not about new problems** —  
they are about **reviewing leadership behavior**.

Each session must use **one** of the lenses below.

---

#### Lens A — Decision Review
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
Decision I made:
 - What I chose
 - What I optimized for
 - What trade-off I accepted
=======

<<<<<<< HEAD
What I want perspective on:
 - Was my framing strong?
```

#### Lens B — Influence Attempt Review
```
Where I tried to influence without authority:
 - Who I was trying to influence
 - Why it mattered
 - What happened

What I want help with:
 - What I misread or underused
```

    ```

A moment I held back or overplayed:
 - What stopped me

### How Phase 2 Is Used
=======
    ```
>>>>>>> 6ed04ff9a1a4e091c48180c3732bdd74c74c9095

<<<<<<< HEAD
Before every mentoring session (after Session 2), pick **one lens** and bring it to the conversation.

If you feel you have nothing to bring, that **is** the discussion.

---

## Phase 3: Pattern Recognition (Sessions 6+)

In this phase, mentoring conversations shift from individual events to **recurring patterns**.

Typical focus areas:
- What you consistently avoid
- Where you default to safety
- Which forms of influence feel hardest
- How you respond to ambiguity and risk

Mentors act as mirrors, not advisors.

---

## 4. Standing Pre-Read (Mandatory After Session 2)

Participants must send the following **24 hours before every mentoring session**.
```
Since our last session:
 - One decision I made
 - One influence attempt
 - One moment of hesitation

I want to discuss:
 - <Pick ONE and why>
```


If you feel you have “nothing,” that is the discussion.

---

## 5. How to Ask Better Questions

### Avoid (Solution-Seeking)
- “What should I do?”
- “What’s the right approach?”
- “What would you do in my place?”

### Use (Judgment-Building)
- “What risk am I underestimating?”
- “What trade-off am I implicitly making?”
- “If this fails, why will it fail?”
- “How would this look from a senior leadership lens?”

---

## 6. What a Good Mentoring Outcome Looks Like

You should leave a session with:
- Clearer framing
- Increased confidence in your own decision
- One behavior to try
- One assumption to test

You should **not** leave with:
- A step-by-step plan
- A decision you do not own
- Someone else’s playbook

---

## 7. If You Feel Stuck After a Few Sessions

This is normal.

It usually means:
- You are operating on autopilot, or
- You have not learned to notice leadership moments yet

Both are exactly what mentorship in this program is designed to address.

Bring **raw leadership moments**, not polished problems.

---

## 8. Final Expectation

Mentorship only works if **you do the thinking**.

Come prepared.  
Own your decisions.  
Use mentors to sharpen judgment — not replace it.

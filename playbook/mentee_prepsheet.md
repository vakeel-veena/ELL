# Mentee Prep Sheet: Getting the Most from Mentorship

This guide helps you transition from "reporting status" to "building judgment." Use this to prepare for your sessions, particularly as you enter **Phase 2 (Sessions 3–5)**.

---

## 1. The 24-Hour Pre-Read
To ensure the session is productive, send this to your mentor **24 hours in advance**:

* **One decision I made:** (What you chose and what you optimized for).
* **One influence attempt:** (Who you tried to move and what happened).
* **One moment of hesitation:** (Where you held back or felt unsure).
* **The Discussion Lens:** Pick **ONE** of the three lenses below to focus our conversation.

## 2. Choosing Your "Lens"
Do not bring a general status update. Instead, frame your preparation through one of these three specific perspectives:

### Lens A: Decision Review
* **Focus**: Pressure-testing your logic.
* **Bring this if**: You made a hard choice and want to know if your framing was strong or if you missed a trade-off.
* **Ask your mentor**: "What risk am I underestimating here?".

### Lens B: Influence Review
* **Focus**: Leading without authority.
* **Bring this if**: You tried to drive an outcome across teams and it stalled or didn't go as planned.
* **Ask your mentor**: "What power dynamics or incentives did I misread?".

### Lens C: Confidence & Visibility
* **Focus**: Reframing risk.
* **Bring this if**: You stayed silent in a high-stakes meeting or overplayed your hand.
* **Ask your mentor**: "How could I have shown up differently in that moment?".

## 3. How to Know if You’re "Doing it Right"
A successful session should feel different than a 1:1 with your manager.

| Good Outcome (Success) | Poor Outcome (Failure) |
| :--- | :--- |
| You have a new assumption to test. | You have a step-by-step to-do list. |
| You feel more confident in *your* decision. | You are following the *mentor's* decision. |
| You have identified a personal behavior pattern. | You solved a technical delivery problem. |

> **Note**: If you feel like you have "nothing to bring," that is your topic. It usually means you are operating on autopilot or avoiding leadership risks—discuss that with your mentor.

# Leadership Development Program – Baseline / Pulse Survey

## Purpose
This survey establishes a baseline for leadership behaviors and helps track changes over time.
It is **not a performance evaluation**. Responses are analyzed **in aggregate** for program learning.

This same survey will be used at:
- Baseline
- Mid-program
- End of program

## Notes for Program Team (Not Visible to Participants)

- Self-ratings represent **self-perception**, not truth.
- Behavior anchors and open-ended responses provide the strongest signals.
- Look for:
  - Gaps between ratings and anchors
  - Increased specificity over time
  - Movement toward consistency, not perfection
- Do not share individual results with leadership or managers.

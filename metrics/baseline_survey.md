# Leadership Development Program – Baseline / Pulse Survey (v1.2)

## Purpose
This survey establishes a behavioral baseline and tracks growth in leadership readiness. It is **not a performance evaluation**. Data is analyzed in aggregate to refine program delivery and assess behavioral shifts.

## Instructions
* **Timeframe:** Reflect only on the **last 4–6 weeks**.
* **Accuracy:** Rate based on **actual actions taken**, not potential capability.
* **Honesty:** High-quality data ensures the program remains relevant to your real-work challenges.

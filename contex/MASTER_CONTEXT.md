## 1. Program Overview

- Program Type: Leadership development for Senior Individual Contributors
- Cohort Size: 23 participants
- Target Audience: Senior ICs (L3+)
- Duration: Multi-week (sessions + mentoring + reflection)
- Format: Facilitated sessions, mentoring, journaling, real-work application

### Core Focus Areas
- Leading Self
- Influencing Culture (without authority)
- Confidence, visibility, ownership, and judgment

This program is **not** a promotion program.  
It is a **leadership readiness program**.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem We Are Solving

The organization has a strong base of technically capable senior individual contributors, but many struggle to consistently demonstrate leadership behaviors beyond their immediate scope.

Specifically:
- High-performing ICs often **wait for direction** instead of exercising ownership.
- Influence is frequently **confused with authority**, leading to hesitation in driving outcomes across teams.
- Confidence, visibility, and assertiveness vary widely, even among capable contributors.
- Leadership potential exists, but is **under-leveraged** due to lack of structured, practical development.

As a result:
- Managers carry unnecessary decision and escalation load.
- Opportunities for proactive problem-solving are missed.
- The leadership pipeline (technical and people leadership) remains inconsistent.

---

### Why Existing Approaches Are Insufficient

- Traditional leadership training is generic and disconnected from real work.
- Development focuses on role readiness, not **behavioral readiness**.
- Feedback is ad hoc and not reinforced through practice.
- Senior ICs lack a safe, structured environment to experiment with leadership behaviors.

---

### What This Program Intentionally Addresses

This program is designed to:
- Help participants **lead self** with clarity, confidence, and accountability.
- Enable influence **without authority** through judgment, communication, and ownership.
- Build leadership behaviors through reflection, mentoring, and application — not theory.
- Create a visible, credible pool of individuals ready for greater scope when needed.

---

### Success Looks Like

- Increased ownership and initiative from participants.
- Reduced dependency and escalation observed by managers.
- Participants influencing outcomes beyond their immediate role.
- Leadership behaviors showing up consistently, not only in formal roles.

---

## 3. Target Participant Profile

Participants are expected to:
- Be strong individual contributors
- Have influence potential beyond their current role
- Be open to reflection and behavior change
- Apply learnings directly to day-to-day work

This program assumes **competence** and focuses on **capability expansion**.

## 5. Cohort Roster

| Name | Role | Org | Strength | Growth Area |
|------|------|-----|----------|-------------|

## 6. Operating Principles

- No motivational or HR-style fluff
- Psychological safety without lowering standards
- Candor and accountability are expected
- Learning is applied, not abstract
- Participants own their development

---

## 7. Mentorship Model

- Mentors are senior leaders / experienced managers
- Mentor-to-participant ratio ~5:1
- Mentors support reflection and perspective, not solutions
- Participants own agenda and preparation

---

## 8. Metrics & Evaluation (High-Level)

### What We Measure
- Engagement (attendance, journaling consistency)
- Behavioral signals (ownership, initiative, influence)
- Manager-observed changes
- Participant self-reflection

### What We Avoid
- Vanity metrics
- Forced rankings
- Comparative scoring between participants

Metrics exist to assess **program effectiveness**, not ind

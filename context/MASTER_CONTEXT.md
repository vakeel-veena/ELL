## 1. Program Overview

- Program Type: Leadership development for Senior Individual Contributors
- Cohort Size: 23 participants
- Target Audience: Senior ICs (L3+)
- Duration: Multi-week (sessions + mentoring + reflection)
- Format: Facilitated sessions, mentoring, journaling, real-work application

### Core Focus Areas
- Leading Self
- Influencing Culture (without authority)
- Confidence, visibility, ownership, and judgment

This program is **not** a promotion program.  
It is a **leadership readiness program**.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem We Are Solving

The organization has a strong base of technically capable senior individual contributors, but many struggle to consistently demonstrate leadership behaviors beyond their immediate scope.

Specifically:
- High-performing ICs often **wait for direction** instead of exercising ownership.
- Influence is frequently **confused with authority**, leading to hesitation in driving outcomes across teams.
- Confidence, visibility, and assertiveness vary widely, even among capable contributors.
- Leadership potential exists, but is **under-leveraged** due to lack of structured, practical development.

As a result:
- Managers carry unnecessary decision and escalation load.
- Opportunities for proactive problem-solving are missed.
- The leadership pipeline (technical and people leadership) remains inconsistent.

---

### Why Existing Approaches Are Insufficient

- Traditional leadership training is generic and disconnected from real work.
- Development focuses on role readiness, not **behavioral readiness**.
- Feedback is ad hoc and not reinforced through practice.
- Senior ICs lack a safe, structured environment to experiment with leadership behaviors.

---

### What This Program Intentionally Addresses

This program is designed to:
- Help participants **lead self** with clarity, confidence, and accountability.
- Enable influence **without authority** through judgment, communication, and ownership.
- Build leadership behaviors through reflection, mentoring, and application — not theory.
- Create a visible, credible pool of individuals ready for greater scope when needed.

---

### Success Looks Like

- Increased ownership and initiative from participants.
- Reduced dependency and escalation observed by managers.
- Participants influencing outcomes beyond their immediate role.
- Leadership behaviors showing up consistently, not only in formal roles.

---

## 3. Target Participant Profile

Participants are expected to:
- Be strong individual contributors
- Have influence potential beyond their current role
- Be open to reflection and behavior change
- Apply learnings directly to day-to-day work

This program assumes **competence** and focuses on **capability expansion**.

---

### 4. Program Structure

### Core Components
- Kickoff session
- Deep dive learning sessions
- Pod-based peer structure
- Mentorship
- Journaling and guided reflection
- Application to real work scenarios

### Pod Model
- The cohort is divided into **5 pods**
- Each pod contains **4–5 participants**
- Each pod is supported by **one Pod Manager**
- Pods act as the primary unit for:
  - Peer discussion
  - Reflection
  - Accountability
  - Applied learning conversations

The pod structure is designed to:
- Increase psychological safety
- Enable deeper discussion
- Reduce facilitation overhead
- Improve consistency of engagement


## 6. Operating Principles

- No motivational or HR-style fluff
- Psychological safety without lowering standards
- Candor and accountability are expected
- Learning is applied, not abstract
- Participants own their development

---

### 7. Mentorship Model

### Pod Managers
- Each pod is supported by **one Pod Manager**
- Pod Managers work with **4–5 participants**
- Pod Managers are responsible for:
  - Facilitating pod discussions
  - Reinforcing program intent and expectations
  - Supporting reflection and perspective
- Pod Managers do **not**:
  - Evaluate performance
  - Provide solutions
  - Replace line managers

### Mentors
- Mentors provide **individual-level support**
- Each mentor supports **no more than 2 participants**
- Mentors focus on:
  - Perspective-building
  - Leadership judgment
  - Confidence and influence challenges
- Mentors do **not**:
  - Manage delivery
  - Evaluate performance
  - Drive decisions

### Capacity Constraint (Non-Negotiable)
- Mentor-to-participant ratio is capped at **1:2**
- This ensures:
  - Meaningful engagement
  - Sustainable mentor bandwidth
  - High-quality developmental conversations

---

## 8. Metrics & Evaluation

### Purpose of Metrics
Metrics are used to assess **program effectiveness and behavior change**, not to evaluate individual performance.

The intent is to:
- Identify early signals of leadership behavior change
- Understand what is working and what needs adjustment
- Provide credible progress updates to leadership
- Enable manager and mentor reinforcement

Metrics are directional and signal-based, not absolute.

---

### Metric Categories

#### 1. Engagement Signals (Leading Self)
Tracked at program and pod level.

Examples:
- Session attendance and participation
- Journaling consistency (self-reported)
- Preparedness for pod and mentor conversations

Primary sources:
- Pod Manager observations
- Participant self-reflection
- Session participation signals

---

#### 2. Capability Signals (Leadership Behaviors)
Observed shifts in how participants operate day to day.

Examples:
- Increased ownership and initiative
- Improved judgment and framing of decisions
- Willingness to influence without formal authority
- Increased confidence and visibility in discussions

Primary sources:
- Manager feedback signals
- Mentor observations
- Participant examples shared during sessions

These signals are qualitative but structured.

---

#### 3. Reinforcement Signals (Manager Interface)
Measures whether leadership behaviors are being reinforced in the flow of work.

Examples:
- Managers noticing and acknowledging behavior change
- Managers creating space for ownership
- Consistency of manager feedback across participants

Primary sources:
- Manager feedback pulses
- Informal manager conversations

This category is critical for sustained impact.

---

### What We Explicitly Do Not Measure
- Individual performance ratings
- Comparative scoring between participants
- Promotion readiness
- Personality traits

The program focuses on **leadership behaviors**, not outcomes tied to appraisal systems.

---

### Signal Collection Cadence
- Session-level signals: After each Deep Dive
- Pod-level signals: Ongoing via Pod Managers
- Mentor signals: Periodic, focused on individual growth
- Manager feedback: At defined checkpoints

Signals are synthesized into program-level assessments.

---

### Reporting & Use of Metrics
- Raw signals are logged in metrics and meeting artifacts
- Signals are synthesized into leadership-facing assessments
- Metrics inform:
  - Adjustments to upcoming Deep Dives
  - Support needed from managers
  - Program design improvements

Metrics drive **learning and course correction**, not judgment.
